Realms of Arcana - The Saurian Empire
=====================================

## The Hidden Empire        

It is said that hidden in the wild Jungles of Enezir are ancient cities, overgrown and abandoned, made entirely of gold. Though there are many who would seek them out, few who do so ever return. Those who find their way home are never the same, muttering to themselves of cold blooded monsters that walk like men.

## Ancient Power

In truth the cities were once home to a great civilization, ancient before the coming of the younger races, known as the Old Ones. They built their cities to channel all the magic of the world, and they were as gods with the power to create and destroy as they saw fit.

To aid them in their tasks they took the primitive creatures of the ancient world and raised them up in mind and body. This was the great empire of the Old Ones, what would become the Saurian Empire.

No one knows what calamity befell that ancient empire, but the races they created continue on, striving to hold on to the ruins of the past. Few of the Old Ones remain, unable to reproduce, these unimaginably ancient creatures persist in a near-death state through their own will and control of magic.

## The Saurian Races

While there are few of the Old Ones left, the inheritors of their legacy are many. 3 separate races were created, each to fulfill a specific role within their empire.

The Itz'oq are the smallest of the races, smaller and slighter than men but fast and clever. Many serve as the hands and eyes of their gods, like priests, delivering the commands and overseeing their divine works.

The Acoetzl are the larger warrior race, bred for their strength and ferocity, they are also gifted with cold cunning and patience. As they mature they are tempered into implacable warriors and brilliant strategists, often leading the armies of the Saurian Empire.

The last race, the Onek are massive creatures twice the height of the Acoetzl. Once they were the pride of the Old Ones, created to rule over the other races in their name, they were also covetous and greedy, and attempted a misguided uprising to claim their own empire.

The Old Ones, disappointed in their creation, easily struck down this rebellion and as punishment for their hubris they again altered the Onek. They dulled their thoughts, making them simple minded creatures, barely more than beasts of burden and weapons of war.
