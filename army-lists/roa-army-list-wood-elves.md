Realms of Arcana - The Woodland Realms
======================================

# Background

## The Forests of Thaedros

<!--

Needs a quick review to properly establish the armies, perhaps keep things more vague about place names.

-->

The forests, jungles, and woodlands of Thaedros are considered dangerous and mysterious places by those that dwell near their borders. Though few have ever seen them and lived to tell of it, the woodland realms are home to the wild and mercurial elves called the Owataën, the Wood Elves.

To the Elves, the great forests are more than a home, for the forests act as a focus for the magic of life and growth. This powerful magic flows through all the living things of the forest, awakening the spirits within the trees, connecting the spirits of all who dwell within the borders. For the Owataën the forest is life itself, without it's magic their souls wither and they fade.

When the woodland realms are threatened by expanding empires, marauding hordes, or the forces of corruption, every elf and every spirit within the realm rises to it's defence.

## Armies of the Wood Elves

<!--

this needs a more coherent rewrite with more emphasis on the heirarchy, illustrating the various aspects of the army

- guardians are normal elves
- dryads are forest spirits
- some warriors are standing forces
- sorcerors and hamadryad
- lords and the blended

-->

When roused to war every elf that can carry a bow or hold a spear rises to the defence of their realm, each a guardian of their home, led by the great warriors and heroes of many past battles. This spirit of defence is carried like a wind through the leaves and so the dryads, spirits that nurture the growth of the forest, come in great numbers.

While the guardians and the dryads hold the line against invaders the true warriors of the realm lead the attack. The most experienced guardians ride the swift horses of the glades into battle, alongside them the great stag riding hunters to break an enemy line. Rangers advance unknown on the enemy to unleash deadly accurate arrows at their weak points. Blade Dancers wield their terrible great blades as they tear through those that threaten their home.

The great leaders of the wood elves are not content to lead from the back, issuing orders from relative safety. The wood elf heroes are all mighty warriors worthy of great legends. They command the greatest creatures and forces of the forest: the great war hawks, the towering treemen, and the mighty forest dragons. Few can stand before them as they advance at the heart of their armies.

The sorcerers of the woodland realm are attuned to the magic that flows through the trees, in the water, and digs deep into the earth. They command great powers of life and growth, an elemental strength few can match.
