You will need [the core rules for Open Fire](https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/openfire/) to play this game.

## Introduction

Realms of Arcana is a game of massed fantasy battles, large armies are represented by small scale miniatures around 10mm tall, with whole regiments of warriors typically on just a few bases.

# Additional Rules and Definitions

### Unit Types

Realms of Arcana has 6 types of unit: Heroes, Regiments, Archers, Cavalry, Artillery, and Monsters. Each unit's type determines what base size the models will use. The sizes of bases given here are merely a suggestion, based around multiples of 20mm, you should feel free to change this to suit your miniatures - so long as everyone is using the same sizes.

### Bases and Formations

**Hero** units are single models mounted on 20mm square or round bases.

**Regiment** units are mounted on 20mm x 40mm rectangle bases with the models aligned along the long edge of the base. Regiment units must be lined up directly behind the unit leader with the long base edges touching to be in formation.

**Archer** units are mounted on 20mm x 40mm rectangle bases with the models aligned along the long edge of the base. Archery units must be lined up to the side of the unit leader with the the short base edges touching to be in formation.

**Cavalry** and **Artillery** units are mounted on 20mm x 40mm rectangle bases with the models aligned along the short edge of the base. Cavalry and Artillery units must be lined up to the side of the unit leader with the long base edges touching to be in formation.

**Monster** units are single models mounted on any suitable sized rectangle base preferably with each dimension being a multiple of 20mm and is aligned according to the facing of the miniature.

### Brigades

Units that are in close proximity to friendly units gain a bonus to their **Command** attribute. Units in base contact with one friendly unit gain +2 and units in base contact with 2 friendly units gain +4.

### Attacks and Arcs

Unless otherwise specified all weapons may only target units in a model's front arc.

**Regiment**, **Archer**, **Cavalry**, and **Artillery** units suffer -2 to their **Defence** attribute from attacks from their side arcs and -4 from attacks from their rear arcs.

### Stress and Breaking from Combat

Any unit that has 3 stress tokens on it is at risk of fleeing the battlefield. At the end of the round, if a unit would take a stress token but already has 3 it must immediately take a **Command** test. If it fails the test the unit begins to flee from the battlefield. The player immediately moves the unit its full Movement Rate directly backwards, then turns it to face in that direction before placing any other models in formation. If this movement cannot be completed due to terrain, other units, or the edge of the battlefield, the unit breaks and is destroyed.

### Height and Shooting

Units that are at a higher height level than their target gain an additional 4 inches to their maximum range when making a ranged attack.

# Module Rules

## Magic

Magic is an essential part of Realms of Arcana and **Spells** are a new type of **Ability** that require the model to have the **Mage (X)** special rule. Unlike normal abilities these models are allowed to choose a number of Spells when the player creates their army list. Each activation the Mage may choose one of their Spells to use. Spells still count as an ability and are still subject to the one ability per activation limit.

To use a spell a Mage must take a **Magic Test** to successfully use the action, refer to the Mage special rule below for details.

## New Special Rules

### Mage (X)

This model may use Spells and attempt to Counterspell enemy Mages.

#### Magic Test

When attempting to use a Spell the model must make a successful **magic test**, rolling a D12 and comparing it to the value of X following the same rules for skill tests. A roll of a 1 on a Magic Test causes the ability to fail and the model automatically loses 1 hit point and gains 1 stress token.

#### Counterspell

If a model with the psyker special rule is within 12 inches of any enemy psyker they suffer a -2 modifier to their psyker test.
