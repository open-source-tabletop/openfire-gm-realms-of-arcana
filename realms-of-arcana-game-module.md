====================

Realms of Arcana is a fantasy battle game featuring large armies in small scales such as 10mm or 6mm.

You will need [the core rules for Open Fire](https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/openfire/) to play this game.

## Introduction

Realms of Arcana is a game of massed fantasy battles, huge armies are represented by small scale miniatures around 10mm tall, with whole regiments of warriors typically on just a few bases.

# Additional Rules and Definitions

## Units

### Bases

All units in Realms of Arcana use one of 4 types of base, though you may modify this to suit any scale you wish to play at, what matters is that both players are using the same base sizes. Bases typically contain anywhere from 1 to 10 miniatures allowing players to play games with large armies without using a large number of models in the game.

For example for most 10mm miniatures the following sizes are used:

- Hero bases are 20mm round bases.
- Regiment bases are 40mm x 20mm with the models aligned to the long base edge.
- Archer bases are also 40mm x 20mm with the models aligned to the long base edge.
- Cavalry bases are 40mm x 20mm with the models aligned to the short base edge.
- Monster bases are 40mm x 60mm with the models aligned to the short base edge.

### Formation

Units in Realms of Arcana stay in base contact with each other at all times.

- Units with regiment bases are in formation when each base is lined up directly behind the leader.
- Units with archer bases are in formation when each base forms a line along the short edges.
- Units with cavalry bases are in formation when each base is aligned along the long base edge.
- Units with hero on monster bases can only contain one model.

### Brigades
