Realms of Arcana
================

Realms of Arcana is a fantasy battle game featuring large armies in small scales such as 10mm or 6mm. You will need [the core rules for Open Fire](https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/openfire/) to play this game.

## Introduction

Realms of Arcana is a game of massed fantasy battles, huge armies are represented by small scale miniatures around 10mm tall, with whole regiments of warriors typically on 1 or 2 small bases.

# Additional Rules and Definitions

## Units

### Bases

All units in Realms of Arcana use one of 4 types of base, though you may modify this to suit any scale you wish to play at, what matters is that both players are using the same base sizes. Bases typically contain anywhere from 1 to 10 miniatures allowing players to play games with large armies without using a large number of models in the game.

For example for most 10mm miniatures the following sizes are used:

- Base Size A is a 20mm round base.
- Base Size B is a 40mm x 20mm base with the models aligned to the long base edge.
- Base Size C is a 40mm x 20mm base with the models aligned to the short base edge.
- Base Size D is a 40mm x 60mm base with the models aligned to the short base edge.

### Formation

Units in Realms of Arcana stay in base contact with each other at all times.

- Units with Base Size B are in formation when each base is lined up directly behind the unit leader so that the long base edges are touching.
- Units with Base Size C are in formation when each base is lined up so that they are all behind the unit leader or to either of the sides of the leader, so that either the long or short edges are touching (but not both at the same time).
- Units with Base Size A or D can only contain one model.

### Brigades

Units that are in close proximity to friendly units gain a bonus to their **Command** attribute. Units in within 2 inches of 1 friendly unit gain +1 and units within 2 inches of 2 or more gain +2.

## Rules

### Breaking From Combat

Units that are below half strength, that is units which have less than half of their total hit points remaining, are at risk of breaking and running from the enemy. If a unit below half strength takes damage from an attack from a unit in assault range they must take a **Command Test**. If the unit fails it will flee from the enemy.

When a unit flees, the leader moves its full movement rate directly backwards, stopping if it hits any terrain it cannot pass. It is then turned to face the direction it travelled. If the unit moves into contact with any enemy units it is completely destroyed and removed as a casualty.

### Height and Shooting

Units that are at a higher height level than their target gain an additional 4 inches to their maximum range when making a shooting attack for each height level they are above their target (up to a maximum of an additional 12 inches).
